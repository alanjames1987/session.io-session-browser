*socket.io-session-browser!*
---

This module uses io.set('authorization') to add a session property to socket.handshake.

This module will then merge the Express and Socket.IO session so it can be used in either place.

This module is meant to be used my browsers, and won't work with mobile devices.

Usage instructions are forthcoming.

**This library is considered Alpha level and shouldn't be used in production.**
